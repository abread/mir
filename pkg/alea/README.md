# Alea-BFT

[Alea-BFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02071) is a practical asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) totally ordered atomic broadcast protocol.
It has a two-stage pipeline design consisting in a proposer disseminating its transactions through an efficient broadcast, followed by an inexpensive binary agreement.

TODO: elaborate on Alea, implementation details, and deviations from original description.
